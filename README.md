# hangman-challenge
Make Hangman in Ruby. A good challenge for beginner-intermediate devs.

Assumed knowledge:

  * Basic understanding of the terminal (bash/cmd)
  * Some knowledge of Ruby and programming concepts (variables, arrays, loops, if/else, etc)
  * Basic understanding of git (enough to clone this repo)

* If anything in that list above is totally foreign to you, fear not! You can either try your hand at the guessing game challenge, or pair program with someone who has more experience. If in doubt, ask nick on slack for help.*

Our end goal in this challenge is to create Hangman on the command line. With any software we make, it's best if we understand what our end product is before we begin.
